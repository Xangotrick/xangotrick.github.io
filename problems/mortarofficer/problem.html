						Problem:
					</h2>
					<p>
						You are an officer during WWII, and you are in charge of aiming a mortar on targets at a given distance; however you are not very good at aiming. This problem is centered around finding a way to correctly aim your mortar, while minimising the amout of shells wasted before correctly hitting your target. <b>The target may be too far for you to reach</b>, in which case, report the issue to your commanding officer.

						Questions:
					</h2>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Download the mortarofficer.py file that will be used for the exercise.</li>
							<br>
							<p>You will answer the following questions by using the designated space in the .py file, and by running that file. <code>target</code> is a random integer that represents the distance of the target to hit. Your mortars must fall within 25m of the target. <code>ballistic()</code> is a function that fires a mortar shell: it takes an angle in degrees as a parameter, and returns the distance at which the mortar hit the ground.</p>
							<p>You may not change the value of target, and the only other pre-build function you may interract with is ballistic, to fire mortar shells.</p>
							<br>
							<li>Write a function that makes you fire mortar shots randomly until you hit the assigned target.</li>
							<li>Write two other functions, each with a more methodical way of finding the correct angle.</li>
							<br>
							<p>HQ warns you that the R.A.F. is flying over the area at a ground height of 600m. It is imperative that our mortar shells do not hit them.</p>
							<br>
							<li>Adapt the three functions to comply with this demand.</li>
							<li>Each mortar shot costs 500$. On average, how much would each method cost to hit a target.</li>
