    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        This is a really simple dish to prepare and itâ€™s always a big hit at
        parties. My father recommends:
    <blockquote>
        "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just
        bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try
        serving it warm."
    </blockquote>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1 t. capers</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth
        as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are
        incorporated, but still retain some
        texture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish
        (optional).

        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new
            cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide
            cooking, you submerge the food <em>(usually vacuum-sealed
            in plastic)</em> into a water bath that is precisely
            set to the target temperature you want the food
            to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>
            Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
            poaching</q>.</p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
            with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
            table, contact us before November 30.</p>

        <p><strong> Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not
            pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
            immunity issues.</strong></p>
