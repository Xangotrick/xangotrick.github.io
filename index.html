        I MET A TRAVELLER from an antique land
        Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
        Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
        Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
        And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

            This is a small bit of text that is going to be floating left hopefully
        </div>
        The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
        And on the pedestal these words appear:
        "My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:
        Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
        Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.
